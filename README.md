# JavaScript Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my JavaScript Algorithms Practice repository! This project is aimed at improving my problem-solving skills and enhancing my understanding of algorithms using JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To run the algorithms in this project, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-algorithms-practice.git
2. **Navigate to the project repository:**
   ```bash
   cd javascript-algorithms-practice
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install

### Running Algorithms 

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file within the algorithms directory. To run a specific algorithm, use the following command:

```bash
  node package/algorithmFileName.js
```
Replace 'package' with the name of the package containing the algorithm that you want to run and 'algorithmFileName.js' with the name of the JavaScript file.


## Algorithms

I have a list of algorithms that I want to create [here](), but will add here only the algorithms already implemented. Feel free so suggest new algorithms ideas :) 

1. **Frequency of a Number in a Range:**

**Description:** This algorithm calculates the frequency of a given number within a specified range of integers. <br>
**File:** countNumbers/countEveryNumberOneInARange.js OR countEveryNumberNineInARange.js

2. **Maximum Element of an Array:**

**Description:** This algorithm finds and prints the maximum element in a given array. <br>
**File:** arrayManipulation/maxElementOfArray.js

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to submit a pull request. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Each algorithm should be in its own file within the algorithms directory.
2. Include a brief explanation of the algorithm and any relevant details in comments within the file.
