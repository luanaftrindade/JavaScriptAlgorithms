# JavaScript Algorithms Practice :computer:	

Welcome to my JavaScript Algorithms Practice repository! :game_die: This project is aimed at improving my problem-solving skills and enhancing my understanding of algorithms using JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To run the algorithms in this project, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-algorithms-practice.git
2. **Navigate to the project repository:**
   ```bash
   cd javascript-algorithms-practice
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install

### Running Algorithms 

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file within the algorithms directory. To run a specific algorithm, use the following command:

```bash
  node package/algorithmFileName.js
```
Replace 'package' with the name of the package containing the algorithm that you want to run and 'algorithmFileName.js' with the name of the JavaScript file.


## Algorithms

I have a list of algorithms that I want to create [here](https://github.com/luanaftrindade/JavaScriptAlgorithms/blob/main/ALGORITHMS.md) (feel free so suggest new algorithms ideas :relieved:). The following list only contains algorithms that have already been implemented:

</div>

### 0. **Maximum Element of an Array:**

**Description:** This algorithm finds and prints the maximum element in a given array. <br>
**File:** arrayManipulation/maxElementInArray.js

### 1. **Second Largest Element of an Array:**

**Description:** This algorithm finds and prints the second largest element in a given array. <br>
**File:** arrayManipulation/secondLargestElemInArray.js

### 2. **Rotate an array to the right by k steps:**

**Description:** The main purpose of the "Rotate an array to the right by k steps" algorithm is to cyclically shift the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of steps (k). This operation is often useful in various scenarios, including: <br>
- *Data Transformation:* When dealing with data structures where cyclic operations are required, such as circular buffers or queues, rotating elements can facilitate efficient data management. <br>
- *Array Manipulation:* In scenarios where you need to change the order of elements in an array, rotating the array can help reorganize the data according to specific requirements. <br>
- *Algorithmic Challenges:* Many algorithmic problems involve array manipulation and rotation. The algorithm can be a fundamental building block for solving such problems efficiently. <br>
- *Optimizing Memory Access:* In certain situations, rotating an array can optimize memory access patterns, especially when dealing with large datasets or specialized data structures. <br>
- *Algorithm Design and Analysis:* Studying and understanding rotation algorithms can provide insights into algorithm design principles, such as in-place manipulation and time complexity analysis. <br>
In summary, the algorithm serves as a practical tool for array manipulation and facilitates various programming tasks and algorithmic challenges. <br>
